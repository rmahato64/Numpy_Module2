# Numpy : Array and Matrices
# Feedback: Mirazum and Sangam


All the code was well labelled with comment and the section was well separated with the details. It was easy to understand
# Command execution
  - Creating numpy array and other variable
  - specific array and examing them
  - reshaping, slicing, selection and many other
  - Vectorized operation and broadcasting h
 # Exercise
The exercise was performed correctly. The standrized function was defined and returned as asked (return array whose column are centered and scaled standered deviation).   
``` python 
 def std(X_1):
        norm_X_1=(X_1-np.mean(X_1))/np.std(X_1)
        return norm_X_1
```
#command that were not inluded
``` python 
np.sort() , Sorts specific axis of arr
np.empty(), return new array of given shape and type
np.info(np.eye) ,  View documentation for np.eye
np.append(arr,values) | Appends values to end of arr
np.insert(arr,2,values) | Inserts values into arr before index 2
``` 

#Google colab experience
The purpose of the assingment was to learn how to use google colab and get the basic knowledge of the numpy. We used google colab, its some how easy. Its something new for us and got stucked sometimes in some points. It was pretty slow and we had to refresh the tab again and again to get updates.
